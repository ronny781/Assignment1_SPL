Studio Manager

Program that simulates a fitness studio management system. The
program will open the studio, assign customers to trainers,
make a workout plan that consists of one or more workout
options, calculate the trainer's salary, and other requests.
The program will get a config file as an input, including all
required information about the fitness studio opening - the
number of trainers, how many customers each trainer can
handle, and details about the studio's possible workouts.
